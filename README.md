# Nicebreakers
When planning an event and trying to find icebreaker activities to do, the best you can find is just pre-compiled lists of icebreakers rather than something that better fits your needs. The solution to that problem is Nicebreakers. Nicebreakers is a social media website where users post their favorite icebreaker activities and questions and can search through the icebreakers that have been posted based on a variety of different filters, so they can find one that fits their specific needs.
