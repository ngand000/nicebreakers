# Nicebreakers


When planning an event and trying to find icebreaker activities to do, the best you can find is just pre-compiled lists of icebreakers rather than something that better fits your needs. The solution to that problem is Nicebreakers. Nicebreakers will be a website where users post their favorite icebreaker activities and questions and can search through the icebreakers that have been posted to the site based on different stats about each icebreaker, so they can find one that fits their needs.
