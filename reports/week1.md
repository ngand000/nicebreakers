    - Researching and watching videos on AWS Amplify and React to have a more robust understanding
    - Refreshing front-end skills by watching videos and skimming over past notes and projects
    - The main issue I had was getting used to AWS as I had never used that before.
    - One thing I learned was more about the AWS framework and conducting risk assessments. Another thing was that most things take longer than expected so it's important to keep that in mind when planning and scheduling.

    - Contributed to the GitHub setup and the Architecture and Design section of living document
    - run React initialization to start a React project on the repo

    - Contributed to Architecture and Design section of living document
    - Started React framework for our website with simple outlines
    - Started implementing a very simple version of the activities page
    - Learned that we should think about the choices we are going to make for longer than I expected, as I expected to get to the coding earlier
  - Shivank:
    - No trouble or difficulties this week:
    - Made revisions to Requirements and Policies based on feedback
      - Added Project Description
      - Added some more detail and specificity to the Major Risks Section
