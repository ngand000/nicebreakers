      - Last Week's Goals:
           - Work on creating a search display and specifically lock down logic of translating display sliders/choices to logic representations of data ranges (ex "ages 5-8" -> int[5, 8] -> database query for this range). Estimate: 2 days
       - Progress and Issues:
           - Added to team Testing and CL shared document section
           - AWS supports Athena paramaterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks, works with DML Queries or SQL prepared statements
           - Paramaterized queries prevent malicious input at runtime, ex: SELECT name FROM 'tablename; Drop table_name'...
           - Working on webpage based on provided wireframe
       - Plans and Goals:
           - Working on Search display webpage using above SQL injection prevention technique

   - Matthew
       - Last Week's Goals:
         - On activities page, display all necessary stats of each icebreaker activity currently stored by the page (later on will be pulled from database). Estimate: 2 days
         - Format page so that icebreaker activities display in the positions the concept drawing shows and can scroll: Estimate: 1 day
       - Progress and Issues:
         - Activities page now has working display of icebreaker activities with necessary stats, and these icebreakers are stored into an array that could be filled by pulling from the database
         - Activities scroll, and have a little animation when you hover over them for clarity/style
         - Only issue was some CSS formatting, will either figure out how to achieve what I want or change layout a bit to avoid this
       - Plans and Goals:
         - Implement filters visually, find some way to store what the current filters are so that backend team can use that data: Estimate: 1 day
         - Implement questions page, should be very similar so try figure out how to do so with copying over as little code as possible and instead reusing existing code: Estimate: 3 days
